Dependency Inversion Principle : Class should depend on interface rather than concrete class.
Solution : Take interface Interface object;

public class Mackbook {

    private final Wiredkeyboard keybord;
    private final WiredMouse mouse;

    Mackbook(){
        keybord = new Wiredkeyboard();
        mouse = new WiredMouse();
    }
}
